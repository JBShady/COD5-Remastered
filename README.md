# Call of Duty: World at War Zombies - Remastered Mod
This mod contains bug fixes, quality of life tweaks, fixed inconsistencies, and other improvements for each of the four stock zombie maps. To install & play, download the release and follow the [installation instructions](https://youtu.be/YbOq6Nb9xug). This repository contains the source files of the project. If you would like to modify it, see the instructions below.

## Build Instructions
* If you are downloading the source code and wish to build it, you will need the latest version of the official [Call of Duty: World at War Mod Tools](https://mega.nz/#!5kwyCYYQ!Onn3s3SfJjrombt7b1lUOcFYAtzhg9T_X7c4SvJljbs) installed before continuing. I also recommend installing the community made [V1.1 Launcher patch](https://www.ugx-mods.com/forum/3rd-party-applications-and-tools/48/world-at-war-mod-tools-v1-1-pwned-w-linkerpc-fix/10245/).
* Drag & drop the "raw" folder, "mods" folder, and d3d9.dll (T4M) file from this repository into your game's root folder. Some files will be replaced, this is normal. (Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Call of Duty World at War) 
* Use the mod tools Launcher to compile each of the four mods. (Check "Build mod.ff FastFile" and "Build IWD File" in each)
* If you notice any issues with the mod after compiling, please let me know. However, I tested the files on a fresh install and everything appeared to work.
* Keep in mind that not every script file (.gsc & .csc) in the \mods directory has been modified, but having them all gives you complete control of every aspect of each map

## Weapons
* All weapons are 100% consistent in stats, behavior, and appearance between each map.

* Weapons cannot share ammo reserves anymore because it was a glitchy system where players could create ammo out of thin air.
